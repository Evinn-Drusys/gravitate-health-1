As for the IPS, we need to take into account the current IG is R4 based. On par with this, several entities still have their IPSs in the R4 format.
This creates a potential problem since the ePI is R5 and handling both versions in a single collection is due to break.

For the purpose of this project, we updated the resources in a R4 IPS to comply with the R5 specification in order to test out the pipeline. In a real production environment, this could be addressed with mappings, updates to content or a more IPA like approach to the data.
