**Adapting information to the context and preferences of the end user for effective and optimal understanding of the information.**


The definition of the several steps in the processing pipeline:
1. Raw ePI: The ePI as is, without changes
2. p(ePI): the preprocessed ePI, with semmnantic annotation
3. f(ePI): the focused ePI format, rendered with personalized data

<div>{% include e2e-pipeline.svg %}</div>

The focused mechanism is complex and can be understood as a multi-step process:
1. first the lenses are attached
2. the persona vector and IPS and consulted/consumed
3. the necessary data elements are attached (CSS classes to certain DIVs)

This will created a focused ePI that can be used to show personalized information to the user.
