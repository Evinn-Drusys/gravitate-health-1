This attribute differs from containedItem.amount in that it can give a single aggregated count of all tablet types in a pack, even when these are different manufactured items. For example a pill pack of 21 tablets plus 7 sugar tablets, can be denoted here as '28 tablets'. This attribute is repeatable so that the different item types in one pack type can be counted (e.g. a count of vials and count of syringes). Each repeat must have different units, so that it is clear what the different sets of counted items are, and it is not intended to allow different counts of similar items (e.g. not '2 tubes and 3 tubes'). Repeats are not to be used to represent different pack sizes (e.g. 20 pack vs. 50 pack) - which would be different instances of this resource.",

Usually modifier elements provide negation or qualification. To make the use of extensions safe and managable, there is a strict set of governance applied to the definition and use of extensions. Though any implementer can define an extension, there is a set of requirements that SHALL be met as part of the definition of the extension. Applications processing a resource are required to check for modifier extensions.\n\nModifier extensions SHALL NOT change the meaning of any elements on Resource or DomainResource (including cannot change the meaning of modifierExtension itself).",
