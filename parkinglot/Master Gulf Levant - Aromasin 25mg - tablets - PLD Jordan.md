 1.	What Aromasin is and what it is used for

 Your medicine is called Aromasin. Aromasin belongs to a group of medicines known as aromatase inhibitors. These medicines interfere with a substance called aromatase, which is needed to make the female sex hormones, oestrogens, especially in postmenopausal women. Reduction in oestrogen levels in the body is a way of treating hormone dependent breast cancer.

 Aromasin is used to treat hormone dependent early breast cancer in postmenopausal women after they have completed 2-3 years of treatment with the medicine tamoxifen.

 Aromasin is also used to treat hormone dependent advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women when a different hormonal drug treatment has not worked well enough.

 2.	What you need to know before you take Aromasin

 Do not take Aromasin:
 •	if you are or have previously been allergic to exemestane (the active ingredient in Aromasin) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
 •	if you have not already been through ‘the menopause’, i.e. you are still having your monthly period.
 •	if you are pregnant, likely to be pregnant or breast-feeding.

 Warnings and precautions
 •	Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Aromasin.
 •	Before treatment with Aromasin, your doctor may want to take blood samples to make sure you have reached the menopause.
 •	Routine checking of your vitamin D level will also be made before treatment, as your level may be very low in the early stages of breast cancer. You will be given vitamin D supplement if your levels are below normal.
 •	Before taking Aromasin, tell your doctor if you have problems with your liver or kidneys.
 •	Tell your doctor if you have a history or are suffering from any condition which affects the strength of your bones. Your doctor may want to measure your bone density before and during the treatment of Aromasin. This is because medicines of this class lower the levels of female hormones and this may lead to a loss of the mineral content of bones, which might decrease their strength.

 Other medicines and Aromasin
 Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.

 Aromasin should not be given at the same time as hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

 The following medicines should be used cautiously when taking Aromasin. Let your doctor know if you are taking medicines such as:
 •	rifampicin (an antibiotic),
 •	carbamazepine or phenytoin (anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy),
 •	the herbal remedy St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), or preparations containing it.

 For those who carry out sports activities: the use of the drug without therapeutic necessity constitutes doping and can however determine positivity to the tests antidoping.

 Pregnancy and breast-feeding

 If you are pregnant or think you might be, tell your doctor.
 Discuss contraception with your doctor if there is any possibility that you may become pregnant.

 Driving and using machines
 If you feel drowsy, dizzy or weak whilst taking Aromasin, you should not attempt to drive or operate machinery.
