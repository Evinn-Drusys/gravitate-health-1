        <p><b>1. What Aromasin is and what it is used for</b></p>
        <p>Your medicine is called Aromasin. Aromasin belongs to a group of medicines known as
            aromatase inhibitors. These medicines interfere with a substance called aromatase, which
            is needed to make the female sex hormones, oestrogens, especially in postmenopausal
            women. Reduction in oestrogen levels in the body is a way of treating hormone dependent
            breast cancer.</p>
        <p>Aromasin is used to treat hormone dependent early breast cancer in postmenopausal women
            after they have completed 2-3 years of treatment with the medicine tamoxifen.</p>
        <p>Aromasin is also used to treat hormone dependent advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal
            women when a different hormonal drug treatment has not worked well enough.</p>
        <p><b>2. What you need to know before you take Aromasin</b></p>
        <p><b>Do not take Aromasin: </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>if you are or have previously been allergic to exemestane (the active ingredient in
                Aromasin) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). </li>
            <li>if you have not already been through ‘the menopause’, i.e. you are still having your
                monthly period. </li>
            <li>if you are pregnant, likely to be pregnant or breast-feeding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Warnings and precautions </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Aromasin. </li>
            <li>Before treatment with Aromasin, your doctor may want to take blood samples to make
                sure you have reached the menopause. </li>
            <li>Routine checking of your vitamin D level will also be made before treatment, as your
                level may be very low in the early stages of breast cancer. You will be given
                vitamin D supplement if your levels are below normal. </li>
            <li>Before taking Aromasin, tell your doctor if you have problems with your liver or
                kidneys. </li>
            <li>Tell your doctor if you have a history or are suffering from any condition which
                affects the strength of your bones. Your doctor may want to measure your bone
                density before and during the treatment of Aromasin. This is because medicines of
                this class lower the levels of female hormones and this may lead to a loss of the
                mineral content of bones, which might decrease their strength.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Other medicines and Aromasin </b></p>
        <p>Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any
            other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</p>
        <p>Aromasin should not be given at the same time as hormone replacement therapy (HRT).</p>
        <p>The following medicines should be used cautiously when taking Aromasin. Let your doctor
            know if you are taking medicines such as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>rifampicin (an antibiotic), </li>
            <li>carbamazepine or phenytoin (anticonvulsants used to treat epilepsy), </li>
            <li>the herbal remedy St John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum), or preparations containing
                it.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>For those who carry out sports activities: the use of the drug without therapeutic
            necessity constitutes doping and can however determine positivity to the tests
            antidoping.</p>
        <p><b>Pregnancy and breast-feeding</b>
        </p>
        <p>Do not take Aromasin if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. If you are pregnant or think
            you might be, tell your doctor. Discuss contraception with your doctor if there is any
            possibility that you may become pregnant.</p>
        <p><b>Driving and using machines</b>
        </p>
        <p>If you feel drowsy, dizzy or weak whilst taking Aromasin, you should not attempt to drive
            or operate machinery.</p>
        <p><b>Aromasin contains sucrose, sodium and methyl parahydroxybenzoate</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to some sugars,
                contact your doctor before taking this medicinal product. </li>
            <li>This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say
                essentially ‘sodium-free’. </li>
            <li>Aromasin contains a small amount of methyl parahydroxybenzoate, which may cause
                allergic reactions (possibly delayed), if this should happen please contact your
                doctor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>3. How to take Aromasin</b></p>
        <p><b>Adults and the elderly patients</b>
        </p>

            you are not sure.</p>
        <p>Aromasin tablets should be taken by mouth after a meal at approximately the same time
            each day. Your doctor will tell you how to take Aromasin and for how long. The

        </p>
        <p>Aromasin is not suitable for use in children.</p>
        <p><b>If you take more Aromasin than you should</b>
        </p>
        <p>If too many tablets are taken by accident, contact your doctor at once or go straight to

        <p><b>If you stop taking Aromasin</b>
        </p>
        <p>Do not stop taking your tablets even if you are feeling well, unless your doctor tells
